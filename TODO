* Coordinate
Coordinate announcements and matches so that only one node is sending.

* Files
Work with const shared pointers to files rather than files to eliminate copy time at the end of the transfer.

* TCP
Study interference with TCP.

* Matches
We accumulate matches without ever forgetting them.  We should purge matches that we haven't seen in a while.
