* Requests
Currently we send a request every 4 seconds.
If we receive all of the fragments we requested in 1 second, then 3 seconds are wasted.
We need to change the request strategy to ensure a steady stream of fragments.

* TCP
Study interference with TCP.

* Validation
Remove validation from file (making a backup of course) because we assume a trusted environment.

* Replace bitsets with interval trees
This is an optimization to avoid scanning bitsets looking for fragments to request/send.
